             Hi, I‚Äôm Emily Davis ‚Äî and at Em‚Äôs Doggy Days, I‚Äôm passionate about helping dogs (and their people!) build better communication, confidence, and trust. With over 12 years of hands-on experience working with dogs of all breeds, I use positive, practical training to help every dog become their best self. When I‚Äôm not working with client dogs, you‚Äôll usually find me training and competing in sport and scent work with my own high-energy Belgian Malinois!
            </p>

            <p>
         You may also meet my partner, John Tappan ‚Äî a lifelong Hopkinton local and fellow dog enthusiast ‚Äî who sometimes lends a helping hand with training sessions.
            </p>
