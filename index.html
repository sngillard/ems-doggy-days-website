      <h2>About Em's Doggy Days</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Em‚Äôs Doggy Days, where every dog can have a good day‚Äîeven if
        they‚Äôve had a few ruff moments! Located in Hopkinton, MA, we specialize
        in professional dog training at our fully fenced, on-site facility. Your
        dog comes to us for personalized training in a safe, structured
        environment ‚Äî no house calls, no chaos, just good old-fashioned doggy
        learning (and a lot of tail wags).
      </p>

      <p>
        We proudly serve dogs from Hopkinton and surrounding towns, including
        Ashland, Holliston, Milford, Southborough, Upton, and Westborough.

        Founded by Emily Davis, a trainer with over 12 years of hands-on
        experience in dog daycares and local training companies, Em‚Äôs Doggy Days
        combines positive reinforcement, clear communication, and a healthy
        sense of humor to help your dog be their best self. Emily knows how to
        get real-world results ‚Äî from backyard basics to high-energy challenges.
        She‚Äôs also an avid trainer in sport and scent work, often spending
        weekends working with her own Belgian Malinois.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll sometimes see her partner, John Tappan ‚Äî another experienced
        handler and Hopkinton local ‚Äî lending a hand with training sessions.
        Together, they‚Äôre passionate about helping dogs (and their humans) build
        confidence, balance, and better communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Em‚Äôs Doggy Days, we believe training should be fun, practical, and
        stress-free. Our goal is to turn those "bad doggy days" into proud
        stories of how your dog went from wild child to calm, confident
        companion.
      </p>
