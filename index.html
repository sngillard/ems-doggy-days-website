          experience in dog daycares and local training companies, Em‚Äôs Doggy

          knows how to get real-world results ‚Äî from backyard basics to
          high-energy challenges. She‚Äôs also an avid trainer in sport and scent
          work, often spending weekends working with her own Belgian Malinois.
